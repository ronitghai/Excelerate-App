## 🧭 Navigation Flow

1. **Launch Screen → Login Screen**  
2. **Login → Home Screen**  
3. **Home → Program Listing Screen (API connected)**  
4. **Program Listing → Program Details Screen**  
5. **Program Details → Feedback Form (validated submission)**

All screens are interconnected using `Navigator.push` and maintain smooth, logical transitions throughout the app.
